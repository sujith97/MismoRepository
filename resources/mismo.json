The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system.

We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country.

Trading partners that agree to use anther address standard may use this extention point.

XAL can hold the data required by the union of requirements in 241+ countries. To assists users of the ADDRESS content meet domestic USPS standards it is strongly recommended that trading partner that select to include XAL extension also populate the noun children elements of ADDRESS.  It would be a kindness to the consumers of the data if the producer also managaged the XAL to USPS mapping by populating it.\r\n\r\nUSPS PUB 28 assembles City State ZIP into &quot;Last Line&quot;.

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system. The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country. It is the responiblity of the user of the data to plac to correct values on the piece of mail correctly.\r\n\r\nNEED TO IDENTIFY THE NAME OF THE FIELDS IN THE PUB 28 WHEN MISMO CHOOSES TO DIVERT\r\n\r\nInclude information regarding if...then on using unparsed vs. parsed information"

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system. The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country. It is the responiblity of the user of the data to plac to correct values on the piece of mail correctly.\r\n\r\nNEED TO IDENTIFY THE NAME OF THE FIELDS IN THE PUB 28 WHEN MISMO CHOOSES TO DIVERT\r\n\r\nInclude information regarding if...then on using unparsed vs. parsed information"

The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country. It is the responiblity of the user of the data to plac to correct values on the piece of mail correctly.\r\n\r\nNEED TO IDENTIFY THE NAME OF THE FIELDS IN THE PUB 28 WHEN MISMO CHOOSES TO DIVERT\r\n\r\nInclude information regarding if...then on using unparsed vs. parsed information"

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system. The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country. It is the responiblity of the user of the data to plac to correct values on the piece of mail correctly.\r\n\r\nNEED TO IDENTIFY THE NAME OF THE FIELDS IN THE PUB 28 WHEN MISMO CHOOSES TO DIVERT\r\n\r\nInclude information regarding if...then on using unparsed vs. parsed information"

Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used.

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system.

We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country.

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system. The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country.

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system. The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country. It is the responiblity of the user of the data to plac to correct values on the piece of mail correctly.\r\n\r\nNEED TO IDENTIFY THE NAME OF THE FIELDS IN THE PUB 28 WHEN MISMO CHOOSES TO DIVERT\r\n\r\nInclude information regarding if...then on using unparsed vs. parsed information"

We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country.

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP.

We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country.

Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used.

The reciever of an address that uses it to format a mail label would need to appliy the formating requirements of pub-28.\r\n\r\nFor example: Pub 28 refers to the address &quot;last line&quot; as being composed of the City &amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;State&amp;lt;&amp;lt;single space&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ZIP. Insertion of the space seperators would be the responsibility of the mail sender system. The ADDRESS container holds the City, State and Postal code values.\r\n\r\nPostal Code vs ZIP CODE\r\nMISMO V2 used Postal Code, to to represent the possibility of the mail recipient being at an address outside the US. We will continue that distinction.\r\n\r\nPub-28 defines a mail format that is complient with the international mailing standard defined by the UPU.  Pub-28 points out that for mail that crosses internationl borders the format of the sending country should be used. The USPS international format is to have COUNTRY as the last line of the address on the piece of mail.  The ADDRESS container has a noun child data point for Country. It is the responiblity of the user of the data to plac to correct values on the piece of mail correctly.\r\n\r\nNEED TO IDENTIFY THE NAME OF THE FIELDS IN THE PUB 28 WHEN MISMO CHOOSES TO DIVERT\r\n\r\nInclude information regarding if...then on using unparsed vs. parsed information"
